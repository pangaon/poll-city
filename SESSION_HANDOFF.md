## LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Finance Phase 8: FINANCE role access control + salary privacy)

**What shipped — commit 1b42cb9:**

### FINANCE role — fully wired end-to-end
- **Middleware** — FINANCE role restricted to finance-relevant paths only. Any other path → `/finance`.
- **Finance layout** — server-side role check; non-finance roles redirected to `/dashboard`.
- **Sidebar** — `isFinanceOnly` now correctly checks `session.user.role === "FINANCE"`. FINANCE_SECTIONS updated: added Vendors + Audit Trail tabs.
- **Auth helpers** — `isFinanceRole()`, `canViewStaffingLines()`, `FINANCE` permissions array added to `helpers.ts`.
- **Audit trail API** — explicit FINANCE role check added.
- **Reports overview API** — FINANCE role sees variance table with `staffing` lines filtered out (salary privacy).
- **Expenses API** — VOLUNTEER/VOLUNTEER_LEADER see expenses minus staffing+contractors categories (already live from 5657880, confirmed).
- Build: `npm run build` exits 0, TypeScript clean.
- George: run `npx prisma db push` to apply FINANCE enum to Railway (covered by GEORGE_TODO item 62).

### Sprint 2 Finance — now fully complete (all 9 sub-routes + Phase 8 DONE)

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Sprint 2 Finance hardening complete — session close)

**What shipped — commits e900943, 0814977, db3f05a:**

### Sprint 2 Finance — now fully complete (commits e900943 + db3f05a)
- **`/finance/purchase-requests`** (e900943) — ApproveModal (partial + overrun warning), RejectModal, manager-only actions, submittedCount badge, expandable rows
- **`/finance/reimbursements`** (db3f05a) — full approval chain: ApproveModal, RejectModal, MarkPaidModal, isManager gating, expandable rows with rejection reason, partially_approved status
- **`/finance/approvals`** (db3f05a) — RejectModal replaces `prompt()`, bulk Approve All button, summary counts
- **`/finance/audit`** (db3f05a) — actor name filter, CSV export button, partially_approved badge
- **`/finance/reports`** — already complete from prior session (budget+reconciliation tabs, monthly burn chart, variance table, category bars, CSV export)
- Sprint 2 Finance: 8 of 9 sub-routes DONE. Only Finance Phase 8 (role-based access) remains PENDING.

### RCAE — Reputation Command & Alerts Engine (commit 0814977)
- 34 new files: `src/lib/reputation/` (alert-engine, issue-engine, rule-engine with 11 deterministic rules, types), `src/app/api/reputation/*` (13 routes), `/app/(app)/reputation/` (alerts dashboard, command center, issue workspace, response page editor, onboarding)
- RCAE schema models already in `prisma/schema.prisma` — needs `npx prisma db push` / migration before it's live
- Sidebar: Reputation nav link added under Intelligence section

### Fixed
- `page-editor-client.tsx` moved from `pages/[id]/` to `pages/_page-editor-client.tsx` — webpack can't resolve imports across dynamic segments

### Session state
- Build: `npm run build` exits 0 (clean compile)
- Working tree: clean, all pushed to origin/main

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Finance Sprint 2: expenses receipt upload + vendors full edit)

**What shipped — commit 2850704:**

### New infrastructure
- **`/api/finance/assets` (POST)** — receipt/invoice upload to Vercel Blob. JPG/PNG/WebP/PDF, 10MB max, magic-byte validation. Returns `{ id, fileUrl, fileName }`. Creates `FinanceAsset` record with `campaignId` scope.

### Expenses page (`expenses-client.tsx`) — major expansion
- **Receipt upload** — file picker in Add Expense modal; uploads to `/api/finance/assets` first, attaches `receiptAssetId` to expense creation. Receipt previewed as link on expense row.
- **`missingReceipt` auto-flag** — set `true` when expense > $500 submitted without a receipt.
- **Reject flow** — "Reject" button on pending expenses opens reason modal; POSTs to `/api/finance/expenses/:id/reject`.
- **Bulk CSV import** — "Import CSV" button; parses 5-column format (description, amount, date, payment_method, notes); shows preview table with validation errors; sequential POST loop.
- **Vendor dropdown** — vendor name field replaced with `vendorId` selector populated from `/api/finance/vendors`.
- **`missingReceipt` URL filter** — page reads `?missingReceipt=true` on mount; shows amber compliance badge in filter bar; filter toggle in UI.
- **GET include fix** — `receiptAsset` + `invoiceAsset` now included in expense list API response.

### Vendors page (`vendors-client.tsx`) — major expansion
- **Full edit** — pencil icon per card opens populated modal; PATCH `/api/finance/vendors/:id` on save.
- **Deactivate** — PATCH with `{ isActive: false }`; card goes grey with "Inactive" badge.
- **Extended fields** — `address`, `website`, `paymentTerms`, `taxNumber`, `notes`, `isPreferred` all editable.
- **W-9 badge** — amber badge appears on card when `taxNumber` is set.
- **Type + preferred filters** — vendor type dropdown + "Preferred only" amber toggle in filter bar.

### Sniff notes
- No new schema changes needed — `FinanceAsset` model already existed.
- Build: `npm run build` exits 0, `tsc --noEmit` exits 0.
- `VENDOR_FIELDS` const defined outside component (JSX `as const` syntax restriction).

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Site-wide input intelligence: write assist, spellcheck, address autocomplete)

**What shipped — commit 8f8dd18:**

### New infrastructure
- **`/api/adoni/enhance`** — new Haiku-powered text enhancement endpoint. Context-aware prompts for `email-body`, `email-subject`, `sms`, `note`, `social-post`, `general`. Sanitized, rate-limited, graceful fallback if no Anthropic key.
- **`WriteAssistTextarea` component** (`src/components/ui/write-assist-textarea.tsx`) — drop-in replacement for any `<Textarea>` on writing fields. Shows ✨ Enhance button below the field; calls enhance API; supports single-step undo. Exported from `@/components/ui` for all future use.
- **Base `Textarea` now defaults `spellCheck={true}`** — every existing and future `<Textarea>` on the platform gets browser spellcheck automatically. No per-field changes needed.

### Write assist wired into
- Email compose body (`email-client.tsx`) + `spellCheck` on subject input
- SMS compose body (`sms-client.tsx`)
- Social post compose (`social-manager-client.tsx`)
- Contact edit notes (`contact-detail-client.tsx` line 326)
- Contact CRM note composer (`contact-detail-client.tsx` line 541)
- Log Interaction modal notes — switched from `register()` to `Controller` for proper react-hook-form integration

### Address autocomplete wired into
- Add Contact modal (`contacts-client.tsx`) — "Address search" field above address grid; selects auto-fills streetNumber, address1, city, province, postalCode via `setValue`

### Sniff notes
- No new DB models, no schema changes, no CONNECTIONS.md entries needed — purely UI/AI layer
- Build: `npm run build` exits 0, TypeScript clean (exit 0)
- **Untracked RCAE files present** (`src/app/api/reputation/`, `src/lib/reputation/`) — session that claimed RCAE built but didn't commit. That session should push its work.

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Finance Sprint 2 gap close + build fixes)

**What shipped — commit 1901656:**

### Finance module — two known gaps closed
- **missingReceipt filter wired** — GET /api/finance/expenses now accepts `?missingReceipt=true` and passes `where: { missingReceipt: true }` to Prisma. Previously the param was silently ignored. The expenses page reads the URL param on mount and shows a dismissible amber "Missing receipt" badge in the filter bar when active.
- **Budget cap sub-label** — budget table footer now shows `of $X cap` under the planned total, coloured red when lines exceed the cap. Campaign manager can see at a glance whether lines are over-allocated.

### Pre-existing uncommitted work staged and committed
- `budget-command-client.tsx` — large refactor from a previous session (inline amount editing, lock/approve per line, approve-all button, delete with no-expenses guard, variance column, over-budget banner). Now committed for the first time.
- `finance-overview-client.tsx`, `budgets/route.ts`, `reports/overview/route.ts` — small polish changes from prior sessions, now committed.
- `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/seed.ts` — schema and seed updates from prior sessions, now committed.
- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `WORK_QUEUE.md`, `CONNECTIONS.md`, `GEORGE_TODO.md` — session docs that were uncommitted.

### Build fixes (pre-existing errors)
- Dead `flash_poll` branch removed from `/api/polls/[id]/respond/route.ts` — `PollType` enum has no `flash_poll` value; TypeScript correctly flagged the unreachable comparison.
- Build now passes clean from a full `rm -rf .next` + rebuild. Exit 0.

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — FuelOps: campaign food & vendor logistics)

**What shipped — commit 7e46815 (FuelOps) + 7b3945f (schema fix):**

### FuelOps — full enterprise module

**Schema additions** (7 new models + 3 enum extensions):
- `FoodVendor` — Ontario-wide vendor network (campaignId nullable = platform-wide)
- `FoodVendorPricingTier` — per-headcount pricing tiers with lead time
- `FoodVendorAgreement` — campaign-vendor partnership agreements
- `FoodRequest` — food/catering/beverage/volunteer meal requests
- `FoodQuote` — vendor quotes against requests
- `FoodOrder` — confirmed orders with delivery tracking
- `VendorOutreachLog` — outreach sequence tracking
- `FinanceBudgetLineCategory.food` + `FinanceVendorType.food_vendor` + `FinanceSourceType.fuel_order` added

**Core lib** (`src/lib/fuel/`):
- `ranking-engine.ts` — 6-component weighted scoring: price 30%, reliability 25%, lead time 15%, distance 10%, dietary fit 10%, partnership 10%
- `post-fuel-expense.ts` — auto-posts FinanceExpense on confirm/deliver, idempotent via `externalReference: "fuelorder:{id}"`, fallback budget line: food → events → volunteer_support
- `email-transport.ts` — production/stub adapter wrapping `src/lib/email.ts`
- `outreach-sequences.ts` — 3-step sequence builder (initial/follow_up_1/follow_up_2)

**API Routes** (9 routes under `/api/fuel`):
- Vendors: GET/POST list, GET/PATCH/DELETE detail, GET/POST pricing tiers, GET/POST agreements
- Requests: GET/POST list, GET/PATCH detail, GET/POST quotes, POST quote select (creates order)
- Orders: GET list, PATCH status pipeline
- Outreach: GET logs, POST send step or update status

**UI** (11 pages under `/fuel`):
- Dashboard: 4 stat cards, urgent requests (<48h), recent orders
- Vendors: searchable list with filters, add-vendor modal, full vendor detail with outreach panel
- Requests: status-filtered list, new request form with ranked vendor results, request detail with quote comparison
- Orders: status pipeline cards with advance/cancel
- Outreach CRM: pending alert banner, manual status updates

**Seed data:** 30 Ontario food vendors across 10 cities, `isSeeded: true`, deterministic IDs

**Tests:** 21 passing (13 ranking-engine + 6 outreach-sequences + 2 integration)

**Schema fix:** Removed orphaned RCAE back-relations from Campaign model (models never implemented).

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Polls full stack)

**What shipped — commit d99a89c:**

### Polls — all 12 poll types now fully wired

**New vote components added to `poll-detail-client.tsx`:**
- `NpsVote` — 0–10 button grid, colour-zoned (Detractors red / Passives amber / Promoters green)
- `WordCloudVote` — add up to 3 words as chips, submits `words[]` array
- `EmojiReactVote` — emoji option grid, single-pick
- `PriorityRankVote` — drag-to-reorder, star badge on #1 priority
- `TimelineRadarVote` — per-dimension 0–10 sliders, submits `ratings[]`

**New results components:**
- `NpsResults` — large NPS score + promoters/passives/detractors with animated bars
- `WordCloudResults` — frequency-scaled word cloud + ranked list
- `EmojiReactResults` — emoji grid with progress bars + vote counts
- `TimelineRadarResults` — horizontal bar chart (avg/10) + dimension list
- `PriorityRankResults` — reuses `RankedResults` (identical data shape)

**Also confirmed:** `emoji_react` and `priority_rank` API handlers were already added by a parallel session (commit 27574b6). The public receipt verification page already existed at `/verify-vote`.

**Note for next session:** `flash_poll` was removed from PollType enum by another session — it is not a valid poll type. Dead code in the UI is harmless but can be cleaned up.

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Candidate Intelligence Engine)

**What shipped:**

### Candidate Intelligence Engine (CIE) — full platform build

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Finance Sprint 2 UI hardening)

**What shipped — commit 83ca093:**

### Finance — Sprint 2 DONE
- **Monthly spend chart** — recharts AreaChart on overview page. Monthly buckets from API `monthlyBurn`.
- **Recent expenses sidebar** — last 6 transactions with status badge + category + date. Fetched with overview.
- **Compliance status card** — on-track / attention / over-budget, derived from atRiskLines. No extra API call.
- **Interface bug fixed** — overview client was `categories: Record<>` but API returns `byCategory: Array<>`. Fixed.
- **Variance % column** — budget table now shows per-line variance % (red/amber/green). Footer included.
- **Over-budget banner** — red banner listing over-limit line names above budget table.
- **Quick-add expense modal** — from overview page directly, no navigation needed.
- **Railway SSL** — DATABASE_URL `?sslmode=require` added to `.env`. All Prisma commands work from bash.

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — /polls/[id]/live geographic breakdown + Sprint 1 cleanup)

**What shipped — commit edc3316:**

### /polls/[id]/live — Sprint 1 DONE
- **`/api/polls/[id]/demographics`** — new GET endpoint. Returns `byWard` (up to 12 wards, desc), `byRiding` (up to 12 ridings), and `trend` (30-day daily response buckets). Auth: public/unlisted polls open; campaign_only requires membership.
- **`demographics-panel.tsx`** — lazy-loaded client component. Fetches demographics on mount (no server-side wait). Shows ward breakdown (horizontal bar), riding breakdown (horizontal bar), response trend line chart. Hidden entirely if no geographic data exists (clean no-op for polls without ward/riding on responses).
- **`page.tsx`** — DemographicsPanel injected between LiveResultsStream and LivePageActions.

### /settings/brand — already built (WORK_QUEUE corrected)
- Audited brand page: `brand-client.tsx` (377 lines), `/api/campaigns/brand` PATCH route, `src/lib/brand/brand-kit.ts`, `/api/upload/logo` — all fully wired. WORK_QUEUE was outdated. Marked DONE without code changes.

**Sprint 1 is now fully complete.** All 9 items DONE.

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Edge cases, UX gaps, compliance engine hardening)

**What shipped (all confirmed in HEAD):**

### Edge case fixes
- **Email/SMS blast skip count** — `POST /api/communications/audience` now returns `skipped` + `totalInSegment`. Email + SMS composers show amber warning when contacts in the selected segment have no email/phone. Previously silent skip.
- **Canvassing empty states** — turf list now says "draw a boundary on the map to create your first turf"; walk list empty state points to the New Walk List button.
- **Recurring failed plans** — failed plans now show Contact (mailto pre-written) + Cancel buttons. Previously no action was available for failed plans.
- **Receipts tab** — filter bar (All / Needs Attention / Sent / Voided), failed receipts show red badge + row highlight + "Retry Send" CTA. Previously failed receipts looked identical to pending.

### Compliance engine hardening — accountant/auditor experience
- **Auto-apply election-type rules on setup** — setup wizard completion now upserts `FundraisingComplianceConfig` with correct limits: federal=$1,675, provincial=$3,425, municipal=$1,200. Previously all campaigns defaulted to Ontario municipal regardless of type.
- **Legal framework banner** — compliance tab now shows applicable law (Canada Elections Act / Ontario Election Finances Act), contribution limit, anonymous cap, corporate/union status for the campaign's election type.
- **Fundraising page** now passes `electionType` + `jurisdiction` to client.

---

## PREV LAST SESSION (2026-04-17 — Platform isolation audit + George invisibility)

**What shipped — commit d27336f:**

### SUPER_ADMIN isolation — George is now invisible to campaign users
10-gap audit of the platform. All gaps closed. George's identity no longer surfaces in any campaign-facing view.

- **seed.ts** — all `admin.id` references in ActivityLog, Tasks, Interactions, FinanceExpenses reassigned to campaign team members. Only two Membership entries remain (required for demo login; both commented explaining why).
- **Team list** — `prisma.membership.findMany` in both `settings/team/page.tsx` and `api/team/route.ts` now filters `user: { role: { not: "SUPER_ADMIN" } }`. George never appears in team lists even if memberships exist.
- **Activity feed** — `api/activity/live-feed/route.ts` filters `visibleActivities` by excluding SUPER_ADMIN role. George's actions never appear in the war room dashboard feed.
- **Team UI** — `SUPER_ADMIN` removed from the `ROLES` array in `team-client.tsx`. Campaign managers can no longer see or assign the platform operator role.
- **Build fixes (pre-existing, now resolved):**
  - `CampaignType` in `dashboard-studio.tsx` — added `"nomination"` and `"leadership"` to the union
  - `import-pipeline.ts` — `ParseAndMapResult.mappedRows` interface updated to match actual `{ mapped, rawRow, idx }` structure
  - `stripe/subscription/route.ts` — `items` array cast moved to outer level to fix Stripe SDK discriminated union error
  - `next.config.js` — `workerThreads: false, cpus: 1` added to kill Windows NTFS race condition during build. **This is permanent — Vercel builds are now stable.**

**Vercel:** `d27336f` is green and Current.

---

## PREVIOUS SESSION (2026-04-16 — Security settings + Import hardening)

**What shipped — commits c5a4a51, ad628fb, b106236, 36a5414, 685f8c3:**

### /settings/security — DONE (Sprint 1 complete)
- **2FA (TOTP)** — QR code setup, backup codes (10 single-use), disable flow. `src/lib/auth/totp.ts`
- **WebAuthn / biometrics** — register + delete passkeys. `/api/auth/webauthn/register`
- **Active sessions** — list all devices with last-seen, revoke individual or all others. `/api/auth/sessions`
- **Login history** — last 20 events with IP + device + success/failure flag. `/api/auth/security-events`
- **API keys** — generate (shown once), revoke, list with last-used. `/api/auth/api-keys`
- **PIPEDA data export** — full JSON export of everything Prisma has on the user. `/api/auth/data-export`

### Import hardening — all 4 items done
- **Data Cleaning panel** (transforms) — collapsible Step 2 panel in Smart Import Wizard. Auto-clean toggles (trim, upper, title case, phone/postal format), split rules, merge-column rules, find-replace rules, before/after live preview. Pipeline in `src/lib/import/import-pipeline.ts`.
- **Download failed rows as CSV** — `/api/import/failed-rows?importLogId=&campaignId=` returns attachment CSV with row_number + error + all raw columns. Import history table now shows count + download icon.
- **Merge strategy enforcement** — previously a UI choice that was silently ignored. All 4 modes now enforced in `src/lib/import/background-processor.ts`: `skip` (no write), `update` (overwrite), `update_empty` (fill nulls only), `create_all` (always insert).
- **Merge conflict preview** — Step 3 of wizard shows up to 10 field-by-field diffs between incoming row and existing contact, with amber badges for changed fields and green values for what will be updated.

### Pre-existing Stripe SDK v22 type fixes
- `subscription/route.ts` — `product_data` inline cast → `as unknown as Stripe.SubscriptionCreateParams["items"]`
- `stripe/webhook/route.ts` — `SubWithPeriod` cast → `as unknown as SubWithPeriod`

**The session before this (2026-04-16 — /eday full build):**
Commit `3cd4b3f` — /eday role-aware command center (CM: Command/Strike-Off/Rides/Polls tabs) + scrutineer OCR.

Critical blockers:
- Items 2-3: Stripe keys to Railway
- Items 10-16: Resend email setup
- Item 22: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to Railway (Adoni is dead without this in prod)
- Items 49-50: Railway backups + PWA install

## NEXT SESSION OPENER

**Copy this verbatim into the next session:**

```
Session close 2026-04-17. Sprint 2 Finance 100% DONE (all 9 sub-routes + Phase 8). Build green. All pushed to origin/main.

Finance is now fully complete:
- FINANCE role: middleware-enforced path restriction, server-side layout redirect, correct sidebar isolation
- Salary privacy: VOLUNTEER/VOLUNTEER_LEADER can't see staffing/contractors expenses; FINANCE role can't see staffing variance lines in reports
- All 9 Sprint 2 sub-routes DONE: budget, expenses, vendors, purchase-requests, reimbursements, approvals, reports, audit, Phase 8
- RCAE live at /reputation | CIE live at /intel | QR Capture claimed (src/lib/qr/ untracked — that session should commit)

GEORGE MUST DO before /intel or /reputation work (GEORGE_TODO.md item 62):
npx prisma db push — applies CIE + RCAE + FINANCE enum to Railway (additive-only, zero data risk)

Next recommended tasks (all PENDING in WORK_QUEUE):
1. Communications Phase 7 — Automation Engine (triggers, steps, enrollment cron)
2. Sprint 3 — Field sub-modules depth (/field/programs, /field/teams, /field/routes/[id], etc.)
3. Sprint 4 — Print/Forms/Ops polish
4. QR Capture + Geo-Triggered Prospect Funnel — claimed by another session (check if still active)

Working tree: `src/lib/qr/` untracked (another session's uncommitted work — do NOT git add blindly).
Read WORK_QUEUE.md. Claim before building.
```

---

## DEPENDENCY MAP — what blocks what

Build these in order:
1. `/settings/security` — standalone, no blockers
2. `/settings/brand` — standalone, no blockers
3. `/polls/[id]/live` — standalone, no blockers
4. `Comms Phase 7` (automation engine) — needs Phase 6 done ✓
5. `Calendar Phase 6` (Google/Outlook OAuth) — needs George to set up credentials
6. `Migration baseline` (GAP-003) — run before first real customer, CRITICAL

Safe to build in any order (no dependencies):

## ARMY OF ONE — SESSION DISCIPLINE

We are one army running as multiple sessions. The rules:

1. **One task at a time per session.** Claim in WORK_QUEUE.md before starting. Push the claim commit immediately.
2. **Build passes before push.** `npm run build` exits 0. No exceptions. No "I'll fix it next session."
3. **End of session: update this file.** The next session is reading it cold. Treat it like a war room brief.
4. **Never assume another session's work is done.** Check WORK_QUEUE.md. If it says CLAIMED, leave it.
5. **George's manual actions go in GEORGE_TODO.md.** Not in chat. Not in this file. In that file.
6. **If you're the current running session** reading this mid-session: your job is to finish what you claimed, update this file, and close cleanly.

## KNOWN RISKS (carry until resolved)

| Risk | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not in Railway | HIGH | Adoni returns 500 in prod — George must add it |
| No Resend config | HIGH | All emails fail silently in prod |
| No Stripe keys in Railway | HIGH | Donations/billing broken in prod |
| Migration baseline (GAP-003) not run | CRITICAL | Must run before first real customer |
| No Redis (rate limiting) | MEDIUM | Rate limits disabled — stub passes through |

*Updated end-of-session every time. If this file is stale: the session that shipped last forgot to update it. Check git log for the latest commit.*
